    Rules:
    - Any subfolder (not the top-level show folders) whose name contains exactly one series of digits is
      considered a season folder, renamed to 'Season NN' (NN zero-padded).
    - For case-only renames (e.g., 'season 01' -> 'Season 01') always perform a
      two-step rename via '.plexleon_swap_Season NN' then to 'Season NN'. If a
      canonical 'Season NN' already exists, merge contents from the swap folder
      into it without overwriting; conflicts are moved into
      'Season NN/.plexleon_conflicts'.
    - Dry-run prints planned operations and makes no changes.
    Returns a 1-tuple with the number of season folders processed (renamed/merged).
